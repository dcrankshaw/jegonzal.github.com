<b>Professor:</b> I recently joined the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu">EECS department</a> at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor.
My <a href="assets/joseph_gonzalez_research_statement.pdf">research interests</a> are at the intersection of machine learning and data systems and explore the challenges of distributed learning and inference on large models and datasets, real-time model serving and personalization, and applying ML techniques to system tuning and management.

<b>Co-founder:</b> I am a co-founder of <a href="http://dato.com">Dato Inc.</a> (formerly GraphLab), which spun out of my thesis work on the <a href="https://github.com/dato-code/PowerGraph">GraphLab & PowerGraph Systems</a>. At Dato we build software that enables data scientists to easily and efficiently extract signal from complex and noisy data and create intelligent applications and services.


<b>Background:</b> Before joining UC Berkeley as an assistant professor, I was a post-doc in the UC Berkeley <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu">AMPLab</a> working on several projects including <a href="http://spark.apache.org/graphx/">GraphX</a> (now part of <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a>), early versions of <a href="http://mlbase.org">MLbase</a>, <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/velox/">Velox</a>, and <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/ccml/">concurrency control for ML</a>.
I got my PhD from the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University
where I worked with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/">Carlos Guestrin</a> on <a href="assets/papers/jegonzal_thesis.pdf">Parallel and Distributed Systems for Probabilistic Reasoning</a>.  I am a recipient of the AT&amp;T Labs Graduate Research Fellowship and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

## Prospective Students ##

I am looking for additional graduate and undergraduate students to join my active projects on large-scale and real-time machine learning.  If you are interested please send me an email and we can setup a time to meet.


I am in the process of updating this website with additional information on active projects, my research group, and teaching information so stay tuned!
